          %p.dialog#d1 Monica: Hey Richard! I am Monica Peter Gregory's assistant
          %p.dialog#d2.hidden Richard: Hi, yeah I remember from meeting you the other day.
          %p.dialog#d3.hidden Monica: Are you okay, you seem really stressed?
          %p.dialog#d4.hidden Richard: I am going to be honest this whole situation has been too much for me and right now I am leaning towards taking the money from Gavin.
          %p.dialog#d5.hidden Underneath the surface of you music application is one of the greatest algorithms that our engineering team has come across. <br /> Do you even realise how revolutionary it could be?
          %p.dialog#d6.hidden Monica: Your algorithm that you created could allow the medical industry to send large amounts of data across the internet in an instant. <br /> The number of positives uses that it could have on the world are almost limitless! Donâ€™t you want to be in the drivers seat when that happens?
